# 🧮 CLI Calculator in C

This project is a simple and advanced Command Line Interface (CLI) calculator built using the C programming language. It demonstrates basic arithmetic functionality as well as extended operations like modulus and exponentiation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `simple_calculator.c`  
  A basic calculator that supports:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division

- `advanced_calculator.c`  
  An extended calculator that includes:
  - All basic operations
  - Modulus (`%`)
  - Exponentiation (`^`)
  - Looping for repeated calculations
